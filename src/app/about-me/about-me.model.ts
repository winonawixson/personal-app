  `I'm a software developer in Columbus, OH. My career began with a degree in mathematics,
  continued with a software bootcamp certificate, was kickstarted by a job at a healthcare startup, and has
  settled into being a consultant. Over the past 5 years I have lived in 5 different states for at least
  3 months each. I love to travel and experience new things. Swimming, kayaking, and hiking are a few of
  my favorite activities, but I still love winter for it's beautiful snow and downhill skiing opportunities!`,

  `Recently I picked up photography as a creative hobby that encourages
  me to explore new places. Nature pictures, especially
 flowers, are my favorite but I'd like to start working on candids and portraits.`
